# ML Theory

This repository contains everything produced by the Machine Learning Theory group in
the Energy Analytics FRI stream at UT Austin in Spring 2020.

graphs/ - contains graphs related to training NODE, with the number at the end
representing the number of epochs trained

images/ - contains images generated by acgan. Images that start with ACGAN21 are produced after being trained longer than images starting with Generated

src/ - contains the final source code (previous versions weren't version controlled)
- acgan.py - modified version of the ACGAN implementation from [here](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN). Specifically, we added data parallelization and made it usable as a module, allowing the generator and discriminator to be used externally to generate images.
- NODE_CIFAR10.py - an implementation of NODE (Neural Ordinary Differential Equations) on the back of a CNN. This one uses CIFAR10 data for training.
- CNNODESynth.py - same as above, except it uses data synthesized by the ACGAN generator.

weights/ - the weights for the neural networks from various components of the project
- CNNODE\*.pth - weights produced by NODE_CIFAR10.py at various epochs
- CNNODESynth\*.pth - weights produced by CNNODESynth.py at various epochs
- generator\*.pth - generator weights produced by acgan.py at various epochs
